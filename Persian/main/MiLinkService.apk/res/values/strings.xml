Connect both your phone and external monitor to the same Wi-Fi network for best effect. If they are connected to different networks, it might take more time to find the external monitor and connect.
Note: Older Mi TVs might not support casting across different networks.
2. If you're using TVs, set-top boxes, or projectors of other brands, connect both your phone and external monitor to the same Wi-Fi network.
If the two devices can't be connected to the same network, turn on Miracast on your external monitor. The naming of Miracast functionality might vary."</string>

If there aren't any Wi-Fi networks available or you can't connect both devices to the same network, check whether the casting features on your external monitor are up to date, turn on Bluetooth both on your phone and the external monitor, and turn on Miracast on your TV. 
2. If you're casting on a Xiaomi device for the first time, you need to complete verification. 
3. If you want to use a non-Xiaomi device, but can't find it in the list of available devices, try the following:
Connect both your phone and the external monitor (e.g. your TV) to the same Wi-Fi network, or connect the external monitor to your phone's hotspot. If this doesn't help, install the LeEco casting app on your TV and follow the instructions."</string>
